# Revisions and The Cloud
## What is Git?
DVCS (Distributed Version Control System) that stores snapshots (commits). It has several key componenents:
* Allows users to work locally on a computer that may not even be connected to the internet
* Tracks every single change made to a file or directory, can even detect corruption or loss of information in transit

Files in Git are one of three states:
1. Modified (Changed but not commited)
2. Commited (Snapshots all tracked in directory)
3. Staged (Ready for commit)

# ACP
* Add, Commit, Push - An order of operations for git to upload to the repository
* Commit by using `git add file.md` or `git add *` will bring modified file/files to staging
* Push with `git push origin main` to finalize changes to selected repository
* Using `git status`, user can see what files are modified, staged, and ready for commit

# Answers
- A system that keeps snapshots of changes made to the file or project. Allows user to revisit previous versions
- `Cloning` - copying all files from a repository to a local computer
- Track & stage files, user can enter file individually with `git add file.md` or mulitple with `git add *`
- Take a snapshot of changed files, enter `git commit.file.md` for single files, `git commit -a` for mulitple
- Sends files to Github, user uses `git push origin main`
