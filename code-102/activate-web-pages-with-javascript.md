# Programming with JavaScript

The **control flow** is the order in which the computer excutes statements in a script. Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish, but also look at program strcture and and how it affects order of excution. [^1]

A JavaScript **function** is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is excuted when "something" invokes it. (calls it). {^2}.

Declaring a function means making a command/rule

A JavaScript function is defined with the *function keyword*, followed by a *name*,  followed by *parantheses* (). Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables). The parenthesis may include parameter names seperated by commas: (parameter1, parameter2, etc.) The code excuted, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {} [^2]
> function name(parameter1,parameter2,parameter3){// code to be excuted}

**Function parameters** are listed inside the parenthese () in the function definition. *Function arguments* are the values received by the function when it is invoked. Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables. [^2]

**Function Invocation** The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

- When an event occurs (when a user clicsk a button)
- When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
- Automatically (self invoked) [^2]

## *Function Delcaration VS Function Expression*

- A function delcaration
- Function Expression can only call it after it has been defined in the code.
