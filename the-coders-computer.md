## Choosing a Text editor

### It is important to remember a few things when choosing a text editor
- They are essentially the same but with different text editing software, varying on the software.
- Whichever you prefer and gets the job done is fine.
  
# The Most Important Features in a Text Editor
- Code Completion
- Suggests code to complete your line of code, saving you time by providing a choice, so you don't finish typing and make typos.
- Emmet: Shorthand (HTML and CSS) language extension to speed up your code writing. (Some text editors come with emmet built in, but can be installed via an extension)
  
# Syntax Highlighting
* Will auto highlight different areas with color so you can differentiate your code for refrence.
  
* Theme Variety (To reduce fatigue & eye strain)
* Can change the background & font colors to help you in your working environment.
*  The ultimate goal is to reduce strain on the eyes.
* A set of extensions readily available to be downloaded.
* The ability to add features to your editor will be handy.
  
> Text editors that come pre-installed on your computer usually lack the neccessary components above. However, if you decide to use these pre-installed programs, make sure your machine does the following:
- Creates plain text code. No options for bold, italics, underlined, etc should be seen here.
- Structure of files should be organized by the user (you). Be sure to save all files in the appropriate folders/subfolders.
- Double check your extensions.
- Double check your written code! No completed code will result in typos that need to be double checked!
