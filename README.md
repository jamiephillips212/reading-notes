~~Growth Mindset~~

*A Growth mindest is when you believe that your abilities can be improved upon. When a person has a growth mindest, they can grow with time and effort. Said person uses their failures to improve. If they have a fixed mindset, they are the complete opposite of the growth mindset. The Growth mindset is the opposite of the fixed mindset, suggesting that success is just an inherent trait and requires no effort to develop.*


> **How to keep the "Growth Mindset"**

     "If I get stuck, embrace it and push through."
     "Seeing others succeed, I will not see them as a threat, but become inspired by their accomplishments."
     "Learn from any criticism that I receive."
