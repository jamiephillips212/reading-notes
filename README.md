*My Journal for Code Fellows Readings* ðŸ“š


Hello! Welcome to my Code Fellows Journal. I'm Jamie Phillips. I wanted to thank you for checking out my journey through the Code Fellows bootcamp courses. Here's a few small tidbits about me:

- I used to be part of a choir group back in Highschool and have a bit of performing arts under my belt.
- Took theatre during Highschool. (but only took it my Freshman and Sophomore years)
- Current favorite artists are Keshi, Demxnita, Glaive, and eaJ.
